# Shift Scheduling Model

This repository implements a mathematical model known as the **Shift Scheduling Model**, which is detailed in the paper [Shift Scheduling with the Goal Programming Method: A Case Study in the Glass Industry](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/7/6/561). The model aims to optimize shift allocation while considering constraints such as worker availability, section requirements, shift, and leave constraints.

The implementation utilizes **Docplex**, a powerful Python library for mathematical programming and optimization provided by IBM. Docplex enables users to define and solve optimization problems efficiently through its high-level modeling capabilities. You can learn more about Docplex and its features at the [Docplex Documentation](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/docplex-doc/mp/index.html).

This code is developed as part of the **TK1-W4-S5-R1 Engineering Optimization** course (ISYE8022045) in the **Master Degree of Industrial Engineering program** at **BINUS University**. The project aims to:

1. Demonstrate the application of the Shift Scheduling Model in a practical scenario.
2. Explore the use of Docplex for building and solving mathematical models.
3. Provide a framework for adapting the model to real-world scheduling problems.
